# hello-world
Storage for ideas, projects,and all else that comes to mind!
I am currently enrolled in a MASc in Civil Engineering at Dalhousie University. My research program specifically focuses in on the effects of germicidal UV on municipal waste waters. My intrests include the use of fluorescence excitation emissions matrices to describe changes during treatment, the applications of LED UV technology over traditional systems, and programing.
